//ClassicSimulator - A class to simulate a classic minigolf ball in the quantum minigolf playing
// fields. It needs two bitmaps, one containing the infinitely high part of the potential,
// folded with the ball shape and a second with the finitely hard part of the potential.
//
// The classic simulator is still heavy work in progress
